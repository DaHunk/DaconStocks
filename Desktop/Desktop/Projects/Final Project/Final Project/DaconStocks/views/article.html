                        <p id="content">Quick answer: The basic idea behind investing in the stock market is to put
                            money you’ve saved into stocks you think will increase in value over time.
                            There is no guarantee that you will make money in stocks. Making your investments pay off
                            takes a lot of work. You need to follow the financial news, use the market indices such as
                            the Dow Jones Industrial Average , S&P 500, and the NASDAQ Composite to watch market trends,
                            and thoroughly research companies you want to invest in.

                        <p id="content">The term “stock market” often refers to one of the major stock market indexes,
                            such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average or the S&P 500. Because it’s hard to track every
                            single stock, these indexes include a section of the stock market and their performance is
                            viewed as representative of the entire market.</p>
